This is a practice project to test my HTML/CSS skills

It is a website for a furniture company to display their products, adverstise their services and give users the oppurtunity to order furniture of diffrent types and request for services.

The site has three pages:-
A PRODUCTS PAGE That you can access through the view more button
A SERVICES PAGE that you can access through the request button in the services section
A PAYMENT PAGE that you can access through the order button in the products card

In the footer ther is a contact form for reaching out to the company

The site is responsive to devices from 350px and above
